# Multi-Criteria Shortest Path Optimization  
Dijkstra Algorithm with Priority Queue

## Overview
A graph-based routing system that computes optimal paths using Dijkstra’s Algorithm enhanced with a Priority Queue.  
The system supports multi-criteria optimization, allowing route selection based on distance, travel time, or both.

## Technical Implementation
- Graph representation using Adjacency Lists
- Custom Priority Queue for efficient node selection
- Dynamic edge weight selection (distance / time)
- Scalable to large graphs (thousands of nodes)
- GUI-based user interaction

## Features
- Computes shortest path by distance
- Computes fastest path by travel time
- Returns full node sequence and total cost
- Efficient performance: O((V + E) log V)

## Input / Output
Input: Road network file (Node1 Node2 Distance Time)  
Output: Optimal path, total distance or time, ordered route
